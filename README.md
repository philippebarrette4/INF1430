## Presentation
This project is based on data that is described here: https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201637

## Data
The files are separated in two directories:
  - Bronze: Source files comming from this website: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/FIE0S4
  - Gold: Files coming from the ones in the Bronze directory but aggregated and ready to use for visualizations and model training. 

## Project
This section is describing how electricity consumption is calculated.

## Scripts
All the code used to explore, transform, visualise, and predict the source data.
  - ETL: Files that are used to transform the "bronze" or "raw" data. (Each consumption type or wheater data is transformed individually.)
  - TN2: Files that explore, analyze, and visualize the "gold" or "curated" data.
  - TN3: Files that predict the "gold" data.
